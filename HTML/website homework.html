    <h2 id="txt2">King Kong</h2>

    <div>
      King Kong is a fictional giant monster resembling a gorilla, who has
      appeared in various media since 1933. He has been dubbed The Eighth Wonder
      of the World, a phrase commonly used within the films. His first
      appearance was in the novelization of the 1933 film King Kong from RKO
      Pictures, with the film premiering a little over two months later. Upon
      its initial release and subsequent re-releases, the film received
      universal acclaim. A sequel quickly followed that same year with The Son
      of Kong, featuring Little Kong. Toho produced King Kong vs. Godzilla
      (1962) featuring a giant Kong battling Toho's Godzilla and King Kong
      Escapes (1967), a film loosely based on Rankin/Bass' The King Kong Show
      (1966-1969). In 1976, Dino De Laurentiis produced a modern remake of the
      original film directed by John Guillermin. A sequel, King Kong Lives,
      followed a decade later featuring a Lady Kong. Another remake of the
      original, this time set in 1933, was released in 2005 from filmmaker Peter
      Jackson. Kong: Skull Island (2017), set in 1973, is part of Legendary
      Entertainment's MonsterVerse, which began with Legendary's reboot of
      Godzilla in 2014. A sequel, Godzilla vs. Kong, once again pitting the
      characters against one another, was released in March 2021. The character
      of King Kong has become one of the world's most famous movie icons, having
      inspired a number of sequels, remakes, spin-offs, imitators, parodies,
      cartoons, books, comics, video games, theme park rides, and a stage play.
      His role in the different narratives varies, ranging from a rampaging
      monster to a tragic antihero.

    <h2 id="txt3">Godzilla</h2>

    <div>
      Godzilla is a fictional monster, or kaiju, originating from a series of
      Japanese films. The character first appeared in the 1954 film Godzilla and
      became a worldwide pop culture icon, appearing in various media, including
      32 films produced by Toho, four Hollywood films and numerous video games,
      novels, comic books and television shows. Godzilla has been dubbed the
      "King of the Monsters", a phrase first used in Godzilla, King of the
      Monsters! (1956), the Americanized version of the original film. Godzilla
      is an enormous, destructive, prehistoric sea monster awakened and
      empowered by nuclear radiation. With the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and
      Nagasaki and the Lucky Dragon 5 incident still fresh in the Japanese
      consciousness, Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for nuclear weapons.
      Others have suggested that Godzilla is a metaphor for the United States, a
      giant beast woken from its slumber which then takes terrible vengeance on
      Japan. As the film series expanded, some stories took on less serious
      undertones, portraying Godzilla as an antihero, or a lesser threat who
      defends humanity. Later films address themes including Japan's
      forgetfulness over its imperial past, natural disasters, and the human
      condition. Godzilla has featured alongside many supporting characters. It
      has faced human opponents such as the JSDF, or other monsters, including
      King Ghidorah, Mechagodzilla and Gigan. Godzilla sometimes has allies,
      such as Rodan, Mothra and Anguirus, and offspring, such as Minilla and
      Godzilla Junior. Godzilla has also fought characters from other franchises
      in crossover media, such as the RKO Pictures/Universal Studios movie
      monster King Kong, as well as various Marvel Comics characters, including
      S.H.I.E.L.D., the Fantastic Four and the Avengers.

    <h2 id="txt4">MechaGodzilla</h2>

    <div>
      Mechagodzilla is a fictional mecha character that first appeared in the
      1974 film Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla. In its debut appearance,
      Mechagodzilla is depicted as an extraterrestrial villain that confronts
      Godzilla. In subsequent iterations, Mechagodzilla is usually depicted as a
      man-made weapon designed to defend Japan from Godzilla. In all
      incarnations, the character is portrayed as a robotic doppelg√§nger with a
      vast array of weaponry, and along with King Ghidorah, is commonly
      considered to be an archenemy of Godzilla.
