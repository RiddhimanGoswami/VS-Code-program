      <h1>Acknowledgement</h1>
      <h2>
        We would like to express our special thanks of gratitude to our history
        teacher, Mrs. Venessa Francis, who gave us the golden opportunity to
        work on this project.<br />
        We would also like to express our gratitude to our school principal, Mr.
        Raja McGee, wholeheartedly.<br />
        This project would not have been possible without the immense support of
        our friends and teachers. <br />The coordination that is seen among us
        is really appreciated. Everyone cooperated well.
