      Mahatma Gandhi was a great patriotic Indian, if not the greatest. He was a
      man of an unbelievably great personality. He certainly does not need
      anyone like us praising him. Furthermore, his efforts for Indian
      independence are unparalleled. Most noteworthy, there would have been a
      significant delay in independence without him. Consequently, the British
      because of his pressure left India in 1947. In this essay on Mahatma
      Gandhi, we will see his contribution and legacy. First of all, Mahatma
      Gandhi was a notable public figure. His role in social and political
      reform was instrumental. Above all, he rid the society of these social
      evils. Hence, many oppressed people felt great relief because of his
      efforts. Gandhi became a famous international figure because of these
      efforts. Furthermore, he became the topic of discussion in many
      international media outlets. Mahatma Gandhi made significant contributions
      to environmental sustainability. Most noteworthy, he said that each person
      should consume according to his needs. The main question that he raised
      was “How much should a person consume?”. Gandhi certainly put forward this
      question. Furthermore, this model of sustainability by Gandhi holds huge
      relevance in current India. This is because currently, India has a very
      high population. There has been the promotion of renewable energy and
      small-scale irrigation systems. This was due to Gandhiji's campaigns
      against excessive industrial development. Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of
      non-violence is probably his most important contribution. This philosophy
      of non-violence is known as Ahimsa. Most noteworthy, Gandhiji's aim was to
      seek independence without violence. He decided to quit the Non-cooperation
      movement after the Chauri-Chaura incident. This was due to the violence at
      the Chauri Chaura incident. Consequently, many became upset at this
      decision. However, Gandhi was relentless in his philosophy of Ahimsa.
      Secularism is yet another contribution of Gandhi. His belief was that no
      religion should have a monopoly on the truth. Mahatma Gandhi certainly
      encouraged friendship between different religions. His struggle certainly
      became an inspiration for leaders. Such leaders are Martin Luther King
      Jr., James Beve, and James Lawson. Furthermore, Gandhi influenced Nelson
      Mandela for his freedom struggle. Also, Lanza del Vasto came to India to
      live with Gandhi. The United Nations has greatly honored Mahatma Gandhi.
      UN has made 2nd October as “the International Day of Nonviolence.”
      Furthermore, many countries observe 30th January as School Day of
      Nonviolence and Peace. The awards given to Mahatma Gandhi are too many to
      discuss. Probably only a few nations remain which have not awarded Mahatma
      Gandhi. In conclusion, Mahatma Gandhi was one of the greatest political
      icons ever. Most noteworthy, Indians revere by describing him as the
      “father of the nation”. His name will certainly remain immortal for all
      generations.

      <div id="txt2">
        The ‘Indian Experiment’ or ‘Non Cooperation Movement’ of 1920-22 was
        undertaken by Indian National Congress under the leadership of Mahatma
        Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi believed that the Government of India functioned
        on the basis of cooperation of Indians. Moreover it was the duty of
        government to pay heed to the demands of the people.But when the
        government refuses to do so then Indians have right to withdraw that
        cooperation and in the absence of such cooperation, the government is
        bound to fall. This movement was responsible for bringing Gandhi within
        the folds of Congress and also for bringing Congress to national
        platform.

        Every segment of Indian society was itching due to the following
        reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>
            ROWLATT ACT:- According to this Act, the government had right to
            detente without trail for a maximum period of 2 years. One could not
            appeal against the orders of court. Thus it outraged the Indians for
            their freedom was at stake.
          </li>
          <li>
            JALLIANWALLA BAGH MASSACRE (1919):-A crowd of young and old had
            gathered for a fair at Jallainwalla Bagh on April 13, 1919. General
            Dyer took the gathering as a sign of opposition and ordered firing.
            As a result, hundred were killed. This outraged the whole country
            against the British.
          </li>
          <li>
            MARTIAL LAW:-British government witnessed oppositions against her
            particularly in Punjab and implemented martial law. Indians were
            further outraged.
          </li>
          <li>
            NEGLECT OF KHILAFAT COMMITTEE:-British government neglected the
            demands of Khilafat Committee which made Indian Muslims angry over
            the British government.
          </li>
          <li>
            RISING PRICES:-High prices of commodities, droughts and epidemics
            were some other reasons which were responsible for the uprising of
            Non-cooperation Movement.

        The campaign for Non-cooperation and boycott started with great
        enthusiasm from early 1921. However some changes in the central emphasis
        of the movement were noticed from one phase to other during the course
        of the movement.
        <ol>
          <li>
            In the first phase the main emphasis was on the boycott of schools,
            colleges, law courts and use of Charkha. There was unrest among
            students. Many lawyers gave up their legal practice
          </li>
          <li>
            In the 2nd phase, there was collection of 10 million rupees for
            Tilak Swaraj Fund. 10 million Congress members were enrolled. 2
            million Charkhas were installed.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the 3rd phase, stress was on boycott of foreign clothes, boycott
            of forthcoming visit of Prince of Wales, popularisation of Charkha
            and Khadi and Jail Bharo by Congress volunteers.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the last phase, there was a shift towards radicalism. The
            Congress volunteers rallied the people and the country was on the
            verge of revolt.

        <h3>WITHDRAWAL OF THE MOVEMENT</h3>
        Following reasons forced Gandhi to withdraw the Non-cooperation
        Movement.When the police opened fire on the mob and killed some persons,
        the angry mob set the police station on fire. As a result 22 policemen
        were burnt alive. Mahatma Gandhi decided to withdraw the movement.
        <ol>
          <li>
            An encounter took place at Chauri Chaura in Bihar on 5th February
            1922 A.D. before the beginning of Civil Disobedience Movement
            between the Satyagrahis and the police.
          </li>
          <li>
            He felt that the movement was turning violent in many places and
            this was against his non-violence principles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Within the Congress, some leaders were tired of mass struggles and
            they now wanted to participate in elections.
