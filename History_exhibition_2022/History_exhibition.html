      On 15th August this year, we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the
      independence of our country India in the form of a festival, which is
      named - "Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav". Our country India got freedom from the
      slavery of the British on 15th August 1947. The celebration of 75 years of
      independence began on 12 March 2021 and will be celebrated till 15 August
      2023. Every Indian is celebrating the 75th anniversary of independence. It
      involves people's participation. On such an auspicious occasion, every
      citizen of the country is celebrating the festival. Why not celebrate?
      After all, after so many struggles, such a happy moment has come in our
      lives of us. When the country was a slave of British rule, then the people
      of India suffered a lot. Our freedom fighters fought a lot and sacrificed
      their lives. Then the British were forced to leave the country. On 15
      August 1947, we get to see independence in the form of partition. The
      British left India and left behind - a country with the worst economy. The
      British had completely looted our country. It was not easy to handle a big
      country like India in such a situation and make it a strong nation
      again.After all, where were we Indians going to give up so easily? We
      tried... After this integration of the country, democracy was established
      in the country. And we Indians again engaged in nation building...! India
      has achieved many achievements in these 75 years. The country has set many
      records. India has made progress in almost every field. Along with
      achievements, India has also seen many ups and downs, but the lord is
      remained firm on its goal.Today's India is present in front of the whole
      world as a strong nation with unity and integrity. From becoming a nuclear
      power to reaching the moon and Mars, whether it is the field of
      production. whether information technology, India is performing very well
      in every field. India is preparing new plans forums for the coming 25
      years i.e Amritkal.The present government is working on many resolutions
      like "Sabka Saath - Sabka Vikas”, “Adopt Swadeshi”, and “Self-reliant
      India". In the coming times also, India will definitely make the dream of
      becoming vishwaguru, come true.
